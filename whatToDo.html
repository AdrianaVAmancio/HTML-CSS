                        <p>The culture of Ireland includes it's traditions and customs, as well as folklore, music, 
                        language, art, and food. The Gaelic culture originated in Ireland but eventually expanded 
                        to Scotland, and much of northwestern Europe. The Irish culture has been influenced by 
                        Scottish, English, and Anglo-Norman cultures throughout history. Today there are cultural 
                        differences between the Protestant and Catholic Irish, and many Irish traditions have become 
                        wn around the world, including Halloween and Saint Patrick's Day. Archaeological evidence has 
                        shown that farming in Ireland began about the time humans first began to settle.</p>
                        <p>Ireland has the highest number of red-haired people per capita in the world. Over 10% of 
                           the population has red hair in Ireland. This is a lot higher than any other countries although 
                           the UK has a high percentage as well.</p>
                        <p>Ireland is the first country in the world that legalised same-sex marriage by referendum, in 2017, 
                           Ireland became the 20th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage.</p>
                        <p>The President of Ireland has little to no power, Ireland’s power is not in the hands of the president, the role is mainly ceremonial and symbolic.
                           The person who really has the power is the head of government, also referred to as “The Taoiseach”.
