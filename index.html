                <h1>Descover Dublin</h1>
                <p>Dublin is the capital and largest city of Ireland. Situated on a bay at the east coast, 
                    at the mouth of the River Liffey, it lies within the province of Leinster. 
                    It is bordered on the south by the Dublin Mountains, a part of the Wicklow Mountains range.</p>
                <p>Dublin is a warm and welcoming city, known for the friendliness of its people and famous for it's 
                    craic (“crack”).The city’s heart is divided north-south by the River Liffey, 
                    with O’Connell’s Bridge connecting the two parts. </p>
                <p>Dublin is quite a compact city so you can walk from the O’Connell Street on the northside to Grafton 
                    Street on the southside in less than ten minutes. The best known bridges that cross the river are the 
                    Halfpenny Bridge and O’Connell Bridge, which is longer in length than it is in width. Some of the best-known 
                    landmarks north of the Liffey are The Spire and the Customs House, while those on the soutside include Dublin 
                    Castle and Christchurch Cathedral. </p>
                <p>There is lots more to see, the attractions include Dublin Castle, Christchurch Cathedral, the city’s numerous parks, and Trinity 
                    College which is home to the famous Book of Kells. </p>
                <p> Many of the world’s best-known writers and musicians were born here, such as James Joyce, Bram Stoker, U2 and other more. </p>
