                <p><b>Dublin bus:</b>Buses serve all areas of Central Dublin, and many suburbs in the Greater Dublin Area too. The best way 
                    to plan a journey by bus is by using Transport for Irelandâ€™s journey planner or the Moovit service. Both tools allow you 
                    to enter a start point and end point for your journey and will then provide you with a map of the route for your journey 
                    along with operator and departure information. It's also import that you know that to pay on the bus you need to have coins 
                    or a leap card, check more informations at <a href="https://www.dublinbus.ie/">Dublin bus</a> website.</p>
