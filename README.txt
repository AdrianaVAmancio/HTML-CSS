Web Development Assignment, Task B

Changes to Requirements
--------------------------
- Wireframes show some of the pages in different colors, but on the development proccess I notice that it
wasn't going to suit the main idea, so I kept everything with the same backgtound color.
- Some of the button that were mention on the wireframes didn't work as planned, so it was took away.
